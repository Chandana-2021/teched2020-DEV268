# Exercise 1

In this exercise, we will create a starter application to collect inventory data. Since we want to concentrate on developing an extension scenario we will try to speed up the process to built the basic inventory application.
 
For this we will use the RAP Generator.


## Connect to the system

1. Start the ABAP Development Tools (aka ABAP in Eclipse)

2. Select a directory as workspace. Click **Launch**

> Here you have to two options how to connect to your SAP Cloud Platform ABAP environment system. We suggest to logon to the SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry Environment and navigate to your ABAP instance. The other option would be to connect directly to the ABAP environment. For this you would have to provide the service key that you have downloaded when setting up your ABAP instance. 

6. Provide the SAP Cloud Foundry connection settings. In this dialogue select the following values

  - Region: Select the region e.g. **Europe (Frankfurt)** or **US East (VA)**.
  - Username: Enter **<your email adress>**
  - Password: Enter **<your password>** you use to log on to SAP Cloud platform

7. Select service instance details

 - Organization: Select your organization e.g. **xxxxxxtrial**
 - Space: Select the space in your CF sub account e.g. **dev**
 - Service instance: Click on the name of your ABAP trial instance e.g. **default_abap-trial**.
 
 Click **Next**.
