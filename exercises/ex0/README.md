>**Please note**

> You have two options how to connect to your SAP Cloud Platform ABAP environment system. We suggest to use the first option. Logon to the **SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry Environment** and navigate to your ABAP instance. The other option would be to connect directly to the ABAP environment. For this you however would have to provide the service key that you have downloaded when setting up your ABAP instance. 

6. Provide the SAP Cloud Foundry connection settings. 

   In this dialogue select the following values

   - Region: Select the region e.g. **Europe (Frankfurt)** or **US East (VA)**.
   - Username: Enter your **email adress**
   - Password: Enter your **password** you use to log on to SAP Cloud platform

   - Space: Select the space in your CF sub account e.g. **dev**
   - Service instance: Click on the name of your ABAP trial instance e.g. **default_abap-trial**.
 
 Click **Next**.

## Choose unique number for the suffix

In this script we will use a suffix for the ABAP repository objects that you will create. This suffix you can choose freely but since we are using shared trial systems it might be that already another user has picked the same suffix.

In this blog it is described how you can check upfront whether the suffix of your choice has already been used by another user or not.

[Blog - How do I find out if the suffix of my choice is already used in an ABAP trial system? ](https://blogs.sap.com/2020/10/20/how-do-i-find-out-if-the-suffix-of-my-choice-is-already-used-in-an-abap-trial-system/)
